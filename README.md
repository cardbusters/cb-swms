# SQL Web Management Studio (swms)

> This project started as trainig project and in the future it can be used as sidecar in a sql container. the idea behind this, when a developer runs a sql container, the developer needs local management studio to be able to manage sql server, for instance, executing sql queries, creating/altering tables/procedures/views, so with this web based management studio, the developer will not need to install any tool in development machine at all. 
> there will be a docker-compose file, 2 containers (sql, swms), 1 network.
